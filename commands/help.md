# WTF-P Command Reference

**WTF-P** (Write The F***ing Paper) gives you 36 commands for writing academic papers, proposals, presentations, and posters. You describe your research. WTF-P breaks it into sections you can plan, write, and review one at a time — tracking everything across sessions so you never lose context.

## Happy Path

New here? These five commands are the core loop. Run them in order:

| Step | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `/wtfp:new-paper` | Start a new paper with guided interview and setup |
| 2 | `/wtfp:create-outline` | Build section outline, argument map, and word budgets |
| 3 | `/wtfp:plan-section 1` | Create detailed writing plan for a section |
| 4 | `/wtfp:write-section` | Write a section by executing its plan |
| 5 | `/wtfp:review-section 1` | Review section for citations, coherence, and requirements |

Repeat steps 3-5 for each section. Run `/wtfp:progress` anytime to see where you are and what to do next.
