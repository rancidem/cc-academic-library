<objective>
Create targeted revision plan from review issues.

Reads ISSUES.md and creates a REVISION.md plan to address identified problems.

Prioritizes blockers, then major issues, then minor issues.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@~/.claude/write-the-f-paper/workflows/plan-section.md
@~/.claude/write-the-f-paper/references/plan-format.md
</execution_context>

<process>

<step name="verify">
**Verify issues exist:**

```bash
ISSUES_FILE="docs/sections/[section-dir]/$ARGUMENTS-ISSUES.md"
[ ! -f "$ISSUES_FILE" ] && echo "ERROR: No issues file found at $ISSUES_FILE" && exit 1
```

</step>

<step name="load">
**Load context:**

- Read the ISSUES.md file
- Read original PLAN.md for context
- Read SUMMARY.md for what was written
- Read the actual section content (paper/[section].md)
- Read PROJECT.md for requirements reference
</step>

<step name="triage">
**Triage issues:**

Group by severity:
- **Blockers:** Must fix before submission
- **Major:** Should fix, impacts quality
- **Minor:** Nice to fix if time allows

Use AskUserQuestion:
- header: "Revision Scope"
- question: "Which issues should we address?"
- options:
  - "Blockers only" — Fix critical issues
  - "Blockers + Major" — Fix important issues
  - "All issues" — Comprehensive revision
  - "Let me select" — I'll specify which

</step>

<step name="create_revision">
**Create REVISION.md:**
