## Hooks

### Desktop Notifications (macOS)
Get native macOS notifications when Claude needs your input or completes tasks.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
brew install terminal-notifier
```

**Included notifications:**
- 🔔 When Claude needs your input
- ✅ When a task is completed

Notifications are automatically enabled when you install the plugin (if `terminal-notifier` is available).

## Installation

### Quick Start

To install and manage plugins, use the `/plugin` command which opens an interactive menu:

```bash
/plugin
```

This will present you with options to:
- Add a plugin (enter `matsengrp/plugins` or `https://github.com/matsengrp/plugins` when prompted)
- Enable/disable installed plugins
- Reload plugins after updates
- Remove plugins

## Usage

### Agents
These agents will be available as specialized subagents that Claude Code can invoke automatically based on your task context, or you can invoke them manually using the Task tool.

### Slash Commands
Use slash commands directly in your conversation:
