<step name="verify">
**Verify project exists:**

```bash
[ ! -f docs/STATE.md ] && echo "ERROR: No project state found. Run /wtfp:new-paper first" && exit 1
```

</step>

<step name="load">
**Load project context:**

- Read STATE.md for current position and session info
- Read PROJECT.md for paper vision
- Read ROADMAP.md for section structure
- Check for .continue-here.md files in section directories
</step>

<step name="check_handoff">
**Check for handoff file:**

```bash
find docs/sections -name ".continue-here.md" 2>/dev/null | head -1
```

If handoff file exists:
- Read it for detailed resumption context
- Extract: current task, remaining work, next action, blockers
</step>

<step name="present">

```
# Resuming: [Paper Title]

## Where You Left Off

```bash
rm docs/sections/XX-name/.continue-here.md
git add docs/sections/XX-name/
git commit -m "docs: resume [section name] from handoff"
```
